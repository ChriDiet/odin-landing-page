Project - Landing page

I learned a lot trough this project! It has been fun (and very frustrating at times) trying to find out the best widths, heights, alignments, colors and so on. I have used a lot of flexbox, probably too much, but I feel like I got a better hang of it through this project. I also implemented a few fun things!
